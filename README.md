### Project Layout

The homepage of the app lists the available movies, each with a "Book a Seat" button.

Accessing the booking page requires that the user is logged in, at which point they may select
a seat and a booking date. If the selected combination of seat, date, and movie is already taken,
the user will be asked to redo their selection. If the selection is unique, the user is brought to
their booking history, which shows the movie, date, and seat number for every booking they have made.
